Hi, I’m Jan (He/Him),

I’m a quantitative psychologist who has spent my entire career in market research, transitioning my skill set towards data science over the past 5 years. My journey has seen me work on a wide array of projects, including forecasting, classification, segmentation, web scraping, and developing Shiny applications. While most of my work revolves around data analysis and visualization, I have also embraced the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), utilizing libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn to enhance my projects. This includes applying these technologies for tasks such as predictive modeling and feature extraction, which have become integral components of my data science toolkit. My experience spans several programming languages, including C++, BASIC (for creating Office apps for formatting tables, updating documents, etc.), R, and Python, with recent projects primarily utilizing R and Python. I consider myself an advanced programmer in these latter two languages, though by no means a master—there's always more to learn.

I’m on the lookout for collaborative opportunities that spark my curiosity and challenge me to grow. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects, tackling innovative data challenges, or exploring cutting-edge technologies in AI and ML, I’m eager to connect with like-minded individuals or teams.

If you have a project in mind or are looking for someone to brainstorm data science ideas with, please feel free to reach out. I’m all ears for anything that piques my interest and pushes my skills to the next level.

Looking forward to making data-driven discoveries together!
